        <h2>The Jedi</h2>
        <p>The Jedi are revered as the guardians of peace and justice. Rooted in the light
          side of the Force, they dedicate their lives to maintaining harmony, protecting
          the innocent, and upholding the Jedi Code. With a rich history spanning thousands
          of years, the Jedi Order has trained generations of Jedi Knights, honing their skills
          in lightsaber combat and harnessing the Force for noble purposes. Throughout the galaxy,
          Jedi are recognized by their distinctive robes, wise teachings, and their ability to perform
          incredible feats with the Force. Despite facing numerous trials and conflicts, the Jedi embody

        <h2>The Sith</h2>
        <p>The Sith, a dark side order in the Star Wars universe, are known for their
          mastery of the Force and their relentless pursuit of power and domination. 
          Throughout history, the Sith have been a malevolent presence, embodying the
          dark side's destructive aspects. Their origins can be traced back to the fallen
          Jedi who embraced their passions and desires, giving rise to the Sith Order. 
          With a strict code and a hierarchy based on the Rule of Two, the Sith sought to overthrow
          the Jedi and establish their rule over the galaxy.</p>
